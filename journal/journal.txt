Week 1 9/8-9/11
My AI usage for this week is pretty simple. I used AI to help calculate the
estimated macros for the food I ate for that day so I can. I would put the
AI chat link here but I used the app on my phone for this one and I'm not sure
how to grab the chat link for those.
Week 2 9/15-9/19
My Ai usage for this week is a little bit more than the previous week. This week
I had some assignment where it required me to brainstorm some ideas with my group
on two of classes. I used ChatGPT to give some ideas on what the topic of our group
is going to do and to help us start with an argument on a question. And that pretty
much what I used AI for this week.
